# RaspberryPi_test
This is a repository for testing **Raspberry Pi** with sensors supporting GPIO.
* HW Info	:	Raspberry Pi Zero W
* SW Info	:	Raspbian Stretch Lite (ver.2019-04-08), Python 3


# Beacon Coordinate Tracking
Using BLE Beacon, it will simultaneously display relative coordinate of target BLE beacon.
The **Raspberry Pi** with **2 BLE Beacon Stones** on the left & right will measure (X,Y) of **target BLE beacon.**
* HW Info	:	Raspberry Pi Zero W, DFRobot BLE Stones
* SW Info	:	Raspbian Stretch Lite (ver.2019-04-08), Python 3, C (for creating **Shared Library**)
